# Project Name
EDA Regionalisation

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals

This new team will focus on identifying opportunities to tailor EDA for country, region, language, dialect, and education operating models. EDA was originally designed for AMER, and is now being used globally. 

In our first sprint we will need to decide what we are seeking to achieve and how, but potential work output: Discovery and design for translations, modifications, and regional extension packs to the EDA data model and functionality: the idea being that you can install a UK, a Spanish, etc extension pack to EDA to take the existing objects and add an additional layer that is specific to the particular country (or greater area if possible) that will add fields (maybe objects also) that are core to the educational use in that particular area, and so EDA is an even closer fit to an areas needs, and there is more commonality or data model between institutions in a specific region.

Goals will be updated once we have decided what they are!  As will the rest of this template 'readme' file.

# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams
